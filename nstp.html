            <h2>Self and the Filipino society</h2>
            <img src="https://quizizz.com/media/resource/gs/quizizz-media/quizzes/3c540f46-9d3b-4fb7-abb4-5cee560d58dd" class="img" width="470" height="290"><br>
            <p>The roots of Filipino characters are deeply 
                intertwined with a diverse array of influences, 
                including indigenous cultures, Malay ancestry, 
                Spanish colonization, Chinese migration, and American 
                colonial rule. These influences have shaped Filipino values, 
                traditions, and identity over centuries, resulting in a unique 
                blend of Eastern and Western elements. The resilience, hospitality, 
                and strong sense of community are often celebrated as quintessential 
                Filipino traits, rooted in the rich tapestry of the nation’s history 
                and cultural heritage.

            <h2>1. Roots of  the Filipino Characters</h2>
            <img src="https://worldculturesproblemsinthephilippines.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/pinoy_ako__by_neilrabi-d5dy4rr.png" class="img" width="450" height="370"><br>
            <p>The concept of the self in Filipino society is deeply influenced by notable 
                impact of colonial history, particularly Spanish and American, which has impacted 
                Filipino identity formation. The Filipino self is characterized by a sense of 
                interconnectedness, collectivism, and strong ties to family and the community.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Kinship</h3>
            <img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/03/90/90/360_F_303909058_zN7dodkF7DTVUNwkWUPcI8VcyBeyrl3h.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Filipino kinship is a simple kinship system of defining family. Though bloodlines 
                have their place, age is how respect is shown. Because respect has such a high value 
                in Philippine culture, it is more important that bloodline ties. So, kinship is 
                determined by generation and age, and to some degree by gender. 
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <img src="https://pinasculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/evolution_of_religious_beliefs.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Religion is the root of Filipino optimism and its capacity to accept life’s hardships. 
                However, religion also instils in the Filipino attitudes of resignation and a pre-occupation 
                with the afterlife. 
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Culture and Language</h3>
            <img src="https://fluentfilipino.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/main-qimg-48e5a48f7624a52a4a697e9f0352bee2.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>The Filipino culture and language serve as rich sources for developing characters in various forms 
                of literature, film, and other media. Language allows to express self authentically through Filipino 
                idioms, expressions, and linguistic quirks. Incorporating elements of Filipino culture and 
                language can make characters more relatable and provide insights into the complexities of Filipino 
                identity.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Family</h3>
            <img src="https://soc2273.weebly.com/uploads/2/3/8/9/23895537/7966111_orig.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Family is considered to be the “ foundation of social life for most Filipinos”. 
                The Nuclear family is the core family unit, however bonds are often tight knit among 
                extended family members. 
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Educational System</h3>
            <img src="https://media.philstar.com/images/the-philippine-star/headlines/20150510/classes-start-9.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>The Filipino educational system plays a crucial role in shaping Filipino characters by instilling values, 
                skills, and knowledge. It serves as the foundation for developing traits such as resilience, adaptability, 
                and resourcefulness. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of family, community, and nationalism, which 
                are integral aspects of Filipino identity. Through its curriculum and extracurricular activities, the 
                educational system also promotes collaboration, empathy, and respect for diversity, reflecting the 
                cultural richness of the Philippines. 
            </p><hr>

            <h2>2. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Filipino Characters</h2>
            <h3>Family and Home Environment</h3>
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*_LY_2PjU0AxKsCF-Ww5cxg.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Child rearing can be both difficult and rewarding at the same time. The goal of every parent is to have 
                the child grow up to be a respectable and resourceful adult in society.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Child Rearing in the Filipino family is characterized by:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>High nurturance - the Filipino child grows up in an atmosphere of love and affection. Providing the 
                    children with the opportunity, means and support to pursue their goals.</li>
                <li>Low independence training</li>
                <li>Over protection - some parents act on their own needs for power and use control and coercion to ensure 
                    that they remain the dominant forces in their children’s lives.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Low discipline Attempts to maintain discipline come in the form of many "no's" and "don'ts" and a system of criticism 
                to keep children in line. Subtle comparisons among siblings also are used by mothers to control their children.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Family Relations</h3>
            <img src="https://media.interaksyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/grab-family-gathering.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <ul>
                <li>In a large family where we are encouraged to get along with our siblings and other relatives, we learn pakikipagkapwa-tao.</li>
                <li>In an authoritarian setting we learn respect for age and authority; at the same time we become passive and 
                    dependent on authority. </li>
            </ul><hr>
            <h3>Family Attitudes and Orientation</h3>
            <img src="https://mariaisquixotic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pexels-photo-13040203-jpeg.webp" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <ul><li>Family Orientation The Filipino’s family orientation may be attributed to the colonial times when the hierarchical 
                structure of family has been in prevalent place, where age and status demand high levels of respect, and the good of the 
                family takes precedence over personal desires. This characteristic is still present despite modern times.
            </li></ul><hr>
            <h3>The Social Environment</h3>
            <img src="https://www.shambhalaschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MOORE_110329_Shambhala_Sch_1938.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>The social environment of the Filipino is characterized by a feudal structure with great gaps between the rich minority 
                and the poor majority.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>The Main Components of the Social Environment are: </h3>
            <ul><li>Social structures</li>
                <li>Social systems such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interpersonal religious</li>
                        <li>Community interaction</li>
                    </ul></li>
            </ul><hr>

            <h3>Culture and Language</h3>
            <img src="https://jefmenguin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/magalang.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <h3>Culture and Language Filipino culture rewards such: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Traits and corresponding behavioral patterns develop because they make one more likable and enable life to proceed 
                    more easily.</li>
                <li>An openness to the outside which easily incorporates foreign elements without a basic consciousness of our cultural 
                    core
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Filipinos has two major language the Pilipino and English, while Philippine has 111 different dialects all over the country.</p>
            <h3>There are 8 popular dialect that are used by Filipinos: </h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Tagalog</li>
                <li>Waray</li>
                <li>Bikol</li>
                <li>Cebuano</li>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://images.summitmedia-digital.com/spotph/images/2018/06/11/D_Manolo_640.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Filipinos are the product of colonial history, which is regarded by many as the culprit behind our lack 
                of nationalism and our colonial mentality. Colonialism developed a mindset in the Filipino which encouraged 
                us to think of the colonial power as superior and more powerful.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>The Educational System</h3>
            <img src="https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/221129012515-158e8b3b21092936fcd1573507b631aa/v1/33a2bce68356d8b331b54fe65b853b9d.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Aside from the problems inherent in the use of a foreign language in the educational system, it leads to other 
                problems for the Filipinos.<br>

                <b><i>“Filipinos develop a mindset that things learned in schools are not related to real life.”</i></b><br>
            </p>
            <p>Aside from the influences of the formal curriculum, there are the influences of the "hidden curriculum" i.e., 
                the values taught informally by the Philippine school system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Schools are highly authoritarian, with the teacher as the central focus.</li>
                <li>The Filipino student learns passivity and conformity</li>
                <li>The Filipino student is taught to be dependent on the teacher. Force Filipino students as well as their 
                    teachers to use school materials that are irrelevant to the Philippine setting</li>
            </ul><hr>
            <h3>The Economic Environment</h3>
            <img src="https://eastasiaforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-02-09T075249Z_2110657624_RC2F7Z94KF41_RTRMADP_3_PHILIPPINES-ECONOMY-scaled-1.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Many Filipino traits are rooted in the poverty and hard life that is the lot of most Filipinos. Our difficulties 
                drive us to take risks, impel us to work very hard, and develop in us the ability to survive. Poverty, however, 
                has also become an excuse for graft and corruption, particularly among the lower rungs of the bureaucracy. 
            </p><hr>
            <h3>The Political Environment</h3>
            <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/08/opinion/9syjuco-inyt-web/9syjuco-inyt-web-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>The Philippine political environment is characterized by a centralization of power. Political power and authority is 
                concentrated in the hands of the elite and the participation of most Filipinos often is limited to voting in elections. 
                Basic services from the government are concentrated in Manila and its outlying towns and provinces. Political power is 
                still very much concentrated in the hands of a few may lead to passivity.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>The Mass Media</h3>
            <img src="https://api.phkule.org/storage/photos/CdkpvKBAAMi1zRKnUc28pywAKr1p4escoHYWze1z.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>The tendency of media to produce escapist movies, soap operas, comics, etc., feed the Filipino's passivity. Rather than 
                confront our poverty and oppression, we fantasize instead. The propensity to use flashy sets, designer clothes, superstars, 
                and other bongga features reinforce porma.
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Leadership and Role Models</h3>
            <img src="https://philnews.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Philippine-President-Trivia-2.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Filipinos look up to their leaders as role models. Political leaders are the main models, but all other leaders serve as 
                role models as well. Thus, when our leaders violate the law or show themselves to be self-serving and driven by personal 
                interest--when there is lack of public accountability--there is a negative impact on the Filipino. 
            </p><hr>
            <h3>Filipino Value System</h3>
            <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*fzoI-cuS4zn4sFsCtblx6A.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Filipino values are the standards or principle that was set by the Filipino society which is right or wrong, the standards 
                or principles that every member of the Filipino society should strive to attain to reach the ultimate realization of their 
                life, regarding their person and about their family and society in general. 
            </p><hr>
            <h3>These are some of the Filipino Values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pagkamaka-Diyos<ol type="I">

            <p>According to a report titled “A Moral Recovery Program: Building a People, Building a Nation” submitted to President Corazon Aquino
