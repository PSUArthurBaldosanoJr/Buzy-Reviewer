            <h3>Rachel Carson</h3>

            <p><b>Silent Spring is an environmental
                science book by Rachel Carson</b>. Published
                on <b>September 27, 1962</b>, the book
                documented the environmental harm
                caused by the <b>indiscriminate use
                of pesticides</b>. Carson accused the chemical
                industry of spreading disinformation, and
                public officials of accepting the
                industry's marketing claims unquestioningly.</p>
            <p>In the late 1950s, Carson focused on environmental 
                conservation, particularly issues caused by synthetic 
                pesticides. Her research led to Silent Spring, which <b>raised 
                environmental concerns</b> among the American public. Despite 
                fierce opposition from chemical companies, the book influenced 
                public opinion, led to a U.S. <b>pesticide policy reversal</b>, a 
                nationwide DDT ban for agricultural use, and inspired the 
                environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. 
                <b>Environmental Protection Agency</b>.</p>
            <p> In <b>2006</b>, Silent Spring was named <b>one
                of the 25 greatest science books of all
                time</b> by the editors

            <h2>Tragedy of the Commons by Garrett Hardin</h2>
            <img src="https://probaway.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/garrett_hardin_3.jpg" class="img"  width="400" height="400">
            <h3>Garrett Hardin</h3>

            <p>First posited in 1968 by American ecologist
                Garret Hardin, the Tragedy of the
                Commons describes a situation where
                shared environmental resources are
                overused and exploited, and eventually
                depleted, posing risks to everyone
                involved.</p>
            <h3>What did Garrett Hardin say about
                the tragedy of the commons?</h3>
            <p>Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of
                the commons that "Freedom in a commons
                brings ruin to all." One of the proposed
                solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate
                access to the common.</p>
            <h3>What problem is Hardin discussing in the
                tragedy of the commons?</h3>
            <p>Hardin wanted to address the "population problem".
                Others want or hope to avoid the problems of
                overpopulation without relinquishing any of the
                privileges they now enjoy. They think that farming
                the seas or developing new strains of wheat will
                solve the problem--technologically.</p><hr>

            <h2>1960s-1970s<br>Earth Day And other Celebrations</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quJFc2kidnxhbtHdNDsrna.jpg" class="img" width="500" height="300">
            <h3>Earth day</h3>

            <p>During the 1960s, hundreds of thousands of
                young Americans rejected the stable,
                comfortable middle-class life their parents had
                built in the years after World War II, driven
                instead by a spirit of rebellion that would
                leave a lasting impact on the nation.</p>

            <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the environmental
                movement focused its attention on pollution
                and successfully pressured Congress to pass
                measures to promote cleaner air and water. In
                the late 1970s, the movement increasingly
                addressed environmental threats created by
                the disposal of toxic waste.</p>
            <p>But long hair and beards for men, tight bell-bottom
                blue jeans and flower crowns for women, and the
                widespread use of mind-altering drugs were only
                the most visible, and easily dismissed, signs of this
                ‘60s “hippie” counterculture</p>
            <p>Far more transformative were the radical social and
                political movements that many of its adherents
                embraced, including the civil rights movement, the
                movement to oppose the Vietnam War and—at the
                tail end of the 1960s and the outset of the 1970s—the
                environmental movement.</p><hr>
            
            <h2>Growing Environmental Consciousness</h2>
            <img src="https://www.earthed.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Restore-Nature-Now-Protest_22-June-2024-1416x944.jpeg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>Rachel Carson’s bestselling book Silent Spring,
                published in 1962, introduced many Americans to the
                devastating effects of the large-scale use of
                pesticides, especially DDT. As the 1960s continued,
                more and more people became aware of other threats
                to the environment, such as automobile emissions, oil
                spills and industrial waste.</p>
            <p>By 1967, the federal government had passed the first
                Clean Air Act, the first federal emissions standards and
                the first list of endangered species (including the bald
                eagle, America’s national symbol). These laws were a
                start, but they did not go far enough to address the
                serious environmental problems facing the nation.</p><br>
            <h3>Images of the 1969 oil spil in Santa Barbara, California fueled outrage over environmental issues.</h3>
            <img src="https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/23/editsbhc-mss10-b75-f09-03_2.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="450">
            <p>In January 1969, the Union Oil well in Santa Barbara,
                California spilled more than 200,000 gallons of oil into the
                Pacific Ocean over 11 days. That June, oil and chemicals
                floating on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio burst
                into flames. Images of such disasters, broadcast across the
                country, helped fuel a growing outrage over the state of the
                environment, especially among young radicals.</p>
            <h3>What environmental disasters of the 1960s
                and 70s led to the creation of
                environmental laws in the US?</h3>
            <p>Along with the Santa Barbara oil spill, the
                Cuyahoga fire and the pollution of Lake Erie and
                other Great Lakes helped galvanize
                environmental consciousness, shift public
                attitudes, and create the climate for federal laws
                such as the National Environmental Policy Act of
                1969 and the Clean Water Act of 1972.</p>
            <p>Interest in conservation increased during the
                1960s as people became more aware of
                pollution, endangered species, and Earth's
                unique characteristics. The first official Earth
                Day was held in April 1970 and included large
                demonstrations across the country in support
                of the environment.</p><hr>
            <h2>1980s-1990s</h2>
            <h3>What were the environmental issues in the 1980s?</h3>
            <p>Acid rain was one of the defining environmental
                issues of the 1980s, causing acid deposition in
                streams and rivers, making them uninhabitable
                for many species. But with increasing efforts to
                clean up sources of acid rain, acidity levels in the
                water had been steadily dropping.</p>
            <p>June 5-16, 1972- UN Scientific
                Conference. As also known the first
                Earth summit happen in Stockholm,
                Sweden<br>Declaration raised the issue of Climate
                Change for the first time.</p>
