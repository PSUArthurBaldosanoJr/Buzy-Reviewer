                <p>
                    User Interface Design is the part of the product that faces the user when he looks at the site, and the User Experience
                    is how they feel when they look at the site.

                <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
                <p>
                    User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the
                    usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.  
                    User experience design encompasses traditional human–computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing
                    all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users ..  
                    - Wikipedia
                </p>
                <p>
                    UX Design is studying user behavior and understanding user motivations with the goal of designing better digital
                    experiences.  
                    Make a better experience for users by understanding their behavior and how they interact with a product or software.  
                    Seriously!
