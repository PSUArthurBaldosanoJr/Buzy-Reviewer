                    <h3>Definition: UI or UX</h3>
                    <p>
                        ▪ A User Interface, also called a "UI" or simply an "interface," is the means in which a person controls a software
                        application or hardware device.  
                        ▪ User experience (UX) involves a person's behaviors, attitudes, and emotions about using a particular product, system, or service.  
                        ▪ GUI – Graphic User Interface

                <h2>Difference</h2>
                <p>
                    User Interface Design is the part of the product that faces the user when he looks at the site, and the User Experience
                    is how they feel when they look at the site.
                </p>
                
                <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
                <p>
                    The design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other
                    electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience.  
                    The aim is to make the user’s interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The design of user interfaces for different software or machines with a clear purpose.  
                    Make a better experience for users when navigating through your app, platform, or website.
                </p>

                    ● The visual elements of a product or digital experience.  
                    ● A translation of a brand’s vision into a product or a software.  
                    ● Common UIs are on: the phone, computer, or tablet; at the ATM; and in your car.

                <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
                <p>
                    User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the
                    usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.  
                    User experience design encompasses traditional human–computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing
                    all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users ..  
                    - Wikipedia
                </p>
                <p>
                    UX Design is studying user behavior and understanding user motivations with the goal of designing better digital
                    experiences.  
                    Make a better experience for users by understanding their behavior and how they interact with a product or software.  
                    Seriously!

                <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
                <h2>UX Laws</h2>
                <p>
                    UX (User Experience) laws are a set of principles that help designers create user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. These laws are based on psychology and behavioral science to improve user interaction and satisfaction.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Key UX Laws</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hick’s Law:</strong> The more choices a user has, the longer it takes for them to make a decision.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fitts’s Law:</strong> The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance and size of the target.</li>
                    <li><strong>Miller’s Law:</strong> The average person can only keep about 7 (±2) items in their working memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jakob’s Law:</strong> Users spend most of their time on other sites, so they expect your site to work the same way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Law of Proximity:</strong> Elements that are close together are perceived as related.</li>
                    <li><strong>Law of Similarity:</strong> Users group similar-looking elements together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Law of Common Region:</strong> Elements located within the same boundary are perceived as related.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
                <h2>Principles of HCI</h2>
                <p>
                    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design principles guide the development of effective and user-friendly systems. These principles are essential for improving usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Eight Golden Rules of HCI</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strive for Consistency:</strong> Maintain uniformity in design elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable Shortcuts:</strong> Provide shortcuts for experienced users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Offer Informative Feedback:</strong> Keep users informed about system status.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design for Closure:</strong> Ensure users understand when a task is completed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevent Errors:</strong> Design to minimize the chances of user errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permit Easy Reversal:</strong> Allow users to undo actions easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support User Control:</strong> Keep users in control of their interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Memory Load:</strong> Present information clearly to reduce cognitive strain.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
                <h2>HCI Guidelines</h2>
                <p>
                    HCI guidelines are specific rules that designers follow to achieve usability and accessibility. These guidelines ensure a standardized and effective approach to interface design.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Key HCI Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintain internal and external consistency across applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Control and Feedback:</strong> Provide clear feedback to users and allow them to control interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use of Metaphors:</strong> Utilize familiar real-world metaphors for ease of understanding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Manipulation:</strong> Encourage intuitive interaction through direct object manipulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aesthetic Design:</strong> Prioritize visual clarity and balance in screen layouts.</li>
                </ul>
