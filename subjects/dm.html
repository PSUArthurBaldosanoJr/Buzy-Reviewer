        <p><b>Discrete Mathematics</b> is a part of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete objects. Discrete means consisting of distinct or unconnected elements.</p>
        <p>It is used whenever objects are being counted, when relationships between finite (countable) sets are studied, and when processes involving a finite number of steps are analyzed.</p>
        
        <h3>Importance of Discrete Mathematics</p></strong>
        <p>The key reason for the growth in the importance of Discrete Mathematics is that information is stored and manipulated by computing machines in a discrete fashion.</p>

        <!-- PROPOSITION -->
         <h2>Proposition</h2>
    <p>A <strong>proposition</strong> is a statement that is either TRUE or FALSE, but not both.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Examples of Propositions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Puerto Princesa City is the capital of the Philippines. <strong>(False)</strong></li>
        <li>123 - 123 = 0 <strong>(True)</strong></li>
        <li>Washington DC is the capital of the USA. <strong>(True)</strong></li>
        <li>25 * 25 = 25 <strong>(False)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Examples of Statements That Are Not Propositions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What time is it?</li>
        <li>X + 12345 = 12345</li>
        <li>X + Y = Z</li>
        <li>She is beautiful.</li>
    </ul>

        <!-- NEGATION -->
        <h2>Negation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Letters are used to denote propositions, just as letters are used to denote variables.</li>
            <li>The conventional letters used for this purpose are <strong>p, q, r, s, ...</strong></li>
            <li>New propositions, called <strong>compound propositions</strong>, are formed from existing propositions using <strong>logical operators</strong>.</li>
            <li>She is beautiful.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Method of producing new propositions</strong></p>
        <p> Methods were discussed by the English mathematician George Boole in 1854 in his book the Laws of Thought. 
            Many mathematical statements are constructed by combining one or more propositions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Let <strong>p</strong> be a proposition. The statement <em>“It is not the case that p”</em> is another proposition, called the <strong>negation</strong> of <strong>p</strong>.</p>
        <p>The negation of <strong>p</strong> is denoted as <strong>¬p</strong> and is read as <em>"not p"</em>.</p>
        <br>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Original proposition: <strong>Today is Friday.</strong></li>
            <li>Negation: <strong>Today is not Friday.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Truth Table for Negation</strong></p>
        <p>A truth table shows the relationship between a proposition and its negation.</p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>p</th><th>¬p</th>

        <p><strong>Important Remarks</p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Sentences involving variable times are not propositions unless a fixed time is assumed.</li>
            <li>The same holds for variable places unless a fixed place is assumed.</li>
            <li>Pronouns must refer to a particular person to be considered propositions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>More Examples</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Original: <strong>There are no corrupt people in the Philippines.</strong><br>Negation: <strong>Some people in the Philippines are corrupt.</strong></li>
            <li>Original: <strong>Dr. Alcid is always late in classes.</strong><br>Negation: <strong>Dr. Alcid has never been late in classes.</strong></li>
            <li>Original: <strong>No cat can sing.</strong><br>Negation: <strong>All cats can sing.</strong></li>

        <!-- CONJUNCTION AND DISJUNCTION -->
    <h2>Conjunction and Disjunction</h2>
    <p><strong>Logical Connectives:</p></strong>
    <p>-Connectives are logical operators used to form new propositions from two or more existing propositions.</p>

    <h3>Conjunction (AND)</h3>
    <p>If <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are propositions, the conjunction "<em>p and q</em>" (denoted as <strong>p ^ q</strong>) is TRUE when both <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are true and FALSE otherwise. The proposition p ^ q is called the conjunction of p and q.</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p ^ q</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td>
        </tr>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>

    <h3>Disjunction (OR)</h3>
    <p>If <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are propositions, the disjunction "<em>p or q</em>" (denoted as <strong>p v q</strong>) is FALSE only when both <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are false. Otherwise, it is TRUE. The proposition p v q is called the disjunction of p and q.</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p v q</th>
        </tr>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
        
        <p>The use of the connective "or" in a disjunction corresponds to one of the ways the word "or" is used in English, namely in an INCLUSIVE way. For example, the statement "Students who have taken Algebra or Fundamentals in IT can take Discrete Mathematics" means students who have taken both Algebra and Fundamentals in IT can take Discrete Mathematics, as well as those who have taken just one of the two subjects.</p>

        <!--Exclusive OR-->
  <h2>Exclusive OR</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Exclusive OR</strong> (XOR) of two propositions, denoted as <strong>p ⊕ q</strong>, is a logical operation that returns <strong>TRUE</strong> when exactly <em>one</em> of the two propositions is true and <strong>FALSE</strong> otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            In simple terms, XOR means "<em>either p or q is true, but not both</em>."
        </p>

        <p><strong>Key Characteristics of XOR</p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Returns <strong>TRUE</strong> if one of the statements is true and the other is false.</li>
            <li>Returns <strong>FALSE</strong> if both statements are either true or false.</li>
            <li>Unlike the inclusive OR (p ∨ q), XOR ensures that both conditions cannot be true simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Truth Table for Exclusive OR (XOR)</p></strong>
        <p>The truth table below shows the behavior of XOR for all possible truth values of p and q.</p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p ⊕ q</th>

                <td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Example of Exclusive OR</p></strong>
        <p>
            Consider a menu at a restaurant that states:  
            <strong>"Soup or salad comes for free."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The restaurant intends to say that customers can have <strong>either soup or salad</strong>, but <strong>not both</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an example of an <strong>Exclusive OR</strong>, as opposed to an <strong>Inclusive OR</strong>, where getting both items would be allowed.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Comparison: XOR vs. OR</p></strong>
        <p>
            The difference between <strong>Exclusive OR (XOR)</strong> and <strong>Inclusive OR</strong> lies in the case when both propositions are true:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inclusive OR (p ∨ q):</strong> TRUE when either or both statements are true.</li>
            <li><strong>Exclusive OR (p ⊕ q):</strong> TRUE only when one statement is true, but not both.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Application of XOR</p></strong>
        <p>
            XOR is widely used in **computer science** and **digital logic**:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In <strong>cryptography</strong>, XOR is a fundamental operation in encryption algorithms.</li>
            <li>In <strong>computer arithmetic</strong>, XOR is used in half-adders and full-adders for binary addition.</li>
            <li>In <strong>error detection</strong>, XOR is used in parity checks to detect data corruption.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- IMPLICATION -->
        <h2>Implication</h2>
        <p>
            In logic, an <strong>implication</strong> is a proposition that establishes a conditional relationship between two statements.  
            It is denoted as <strong>p → q</strong>, meaning "<em>if p, then q</em>."
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, <strong>p</strong> is called the <em>hypothesis</em> (or antecedent), and <strong>q</strong> is called the <em>conclusion</em> (or consequence).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Ways to Express an Implication</p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If p, then q</li>
            <li>p implies q</li>
            <li>p only if q</li>
            <li>p is sufficient for q</li>
            <li>q if p</li>
            <li>q whenever p</li>
            <li>q is necessary for p</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Truth Table for Implication</p></strong>
        <p>
            The implication <strong>p → q</strong> is FALSE only when <strong>p is true and q is false</strong>.  
            In all other cases, the implication is TRUE.
        </p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p → q</th>

            <tr>
                <td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td>
            </tr>

        <p><strong>Understanding Implication in Real Life</p></strong>
        <p>
            A useful way to understand implications is by thinking of them as <strong>contracts</strong> or <strong>obligations</strong>.  
            If the condition is not met, there is no obligation to fulfill the consequence.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example 1</p></strong>
        <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> "If you make more than Php 25,000.00, then you must file an income tax return."
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This does not say anything about those earning less than Php 25,000.00.</li>
            <li>It is violated only if someone earns more than Php 25,000.00 and does not file a tax return.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Example 2</p></strong>
        <p>
            <strong>Statement:</strong> "If a baseball player hits more than 60 home runs, then they receive a bonus of 1 million pesos."
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player hits more than 60 home runs but does not receive the bonus, the implication is violated.</li>
            <li>If they hit fewer than 60 home runs, the rule does not apply, so the statement remains true.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Implication in Programming</p></strong>
        <p>
            In programming, the <strong>IF-THEN</strong> structure follows a different logic.  
            If the condition <strong>p</strong> is true, the statement <strong>s</strong> is executed. If <strong>p</strong> is false, nothing happens.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</p></strong>
        <pre>
            x = 0
            If (2 + 2 = 4) then x := x + 1
        </pre>
        <p>
            Since <strong>2 + 2 = 4</strong> is true, the statement <strong>x := x + 1</strong> is executed, making x = 1.
        </p>

        <h3>Converse and Contrapositive</h3>
        <p>
            Additional logical statements can be derived from an implication <strong>p → q</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Converse</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>converse</strong> of <strong>p → q</strong> is <strong>q → p</strong>.  
            This means "<em>if q, then p</em>."
        </p>

        <h3>Contrapositive</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>contrapositive</strong> of <strong>p → q</strong> is <strong>¬q → ¬p</strong>.  
            This means "<em>if not q, then not p</em>."
        </p>

        <p><strong>Example:</p></strong>
        <p>
            <strong>Original Statement:</strong> "If today is Thursday, then I have a test today."
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Converse:</strong> "If I have a test today, then today is Thursday."</li>
            <li><strong>Contrapositive:</strong> "If I do not have a test today, then today is not Thursday."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Logical Operators and Parentheses</h3>
        <p>
            Logical expressions often contain multiple operators. Parentheses are used to specify the order of operations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>(p ∨ q) ∧ (¬r)</strong> → This is the conjunction of <strong>p ∨ q</strong> and <strong>¬r</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>¬p ∧ q</strong> → This is the conjunction of <strong>¬p</strong> and <strong>q</strong>, written as <strong>(¬p) ∧ q</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>¬(p ∧ q)</strong> → This is NOT the same as <strong>(¬p) ∧ q</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
