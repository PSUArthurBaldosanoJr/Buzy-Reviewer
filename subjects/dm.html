        <p>Discrete Mathematics is a part of mathematics devoted to the study of discrete objects. Discrete means consisting of distinct or unconnected elements.</p>
        <p>It is used whenever objects are being counted, when relationships between finite (countable) sets are studied, and when processes involving a finite number of steps are analyzed.</p>
        
        <h2>Importance of Discrete Mathematics</h2>
        <p>The key reason for the growth in the importance of Discrete Mathematics is that information is stored and manipulated by computing machines in a discrete fashion.</p>
        
        <h2>Problems Solved Using Discrete Mathematics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How many ways are there to choose a valid password in a computer system?</li>
            <li>What is the probability of winning a lottery?</li>
            <li>Is there a link between computers in a network?</li>
            <li>What is the shortest path between two cities using a transportation system?</li>
            <li>How can a list of integers be sorted so that they are arranged in increasing order?</li>
            <li>How many steps are required to do such sorting?</li>
            <li>How can a circuit that adds two integers be designed?</li>
            <li>How many valid internet addresses are there?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Study Discrete Mathematics?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Develops mathematical maturity.</li>
            <li>Enhances the ability to understand and create mathematical arguments.</li>
            <li>It is the gateway to more advanced courses in all parts of mathematical sciences.</li>
            <li>Provides mathematical foundations for many IT and computer science courses, including data structures, algorithms, database theory, automata theory, formal languages, compiler theory, computer security, and operating systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>George Boole and Boolean Algebra</h2>
        <p>George Boole introduced Boolean Algebra in 1849. He struggled to educate himself while supporting his family.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1848 – Published "Mathematical Analysis of Logic"</li>
            <li>1849 – Published "The Laws of Thought"</li>
            <li>1864 – Died of pneumonia after keeping a lecture engagement even while soaking from a wet storm.</li>
