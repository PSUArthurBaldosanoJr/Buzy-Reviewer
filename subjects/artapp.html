            <h1>Lesson 1</h1><br>
            <h2>Understanding Humanities, Art, and Human Essence</h2>
            <h3>Lesson 1.1. Humanities and the Arts<br></h3>
            <p>In the age of <b>Instagram and Facebook</b>, it is very easy to come across a work of art which
                is made, remade, or reused to fit a certain purpose or value. You must have pressed that “like” or
                “love” button as you deem a graphic post so relatable. YouTube offers lots of tutorials and
                techniques for painting, calligraphy, watercolor and others; lots of young artists have been
                exposed to a wide range of art techniques because of them. Art and information is now within our
                reach. There are so many sources available to learn from.<br><br>
                
                The downside of this quick information is that it is very scattered. We do not know which to prioritize and are unsure if we are getting the right information.<br>
                
                Art Appreciation on the other hand is a discipline offered in an academic to direct our<br>
                
                often ambivalent feelings toward art which is a good starting point: YOU.</p><hr>

            <p>The concept of <i>"humanity"</i> originally distinguished humans from animals and those considered
                subhuman, such as barbarians and slaves. During the Middle Ages, a shift toward the divine
                led to a reconsideration of humanity’s status in relation to God, emphasizing mortality rather
                than superiority. This change influenced the rise of humanism, which balanced rationality and
                freedom with an awareness of human fallibility, fostering responsibility and tolerance.

            <p>
                With humanism’s rise, <b>artistic styles evolved through learning from, rather than imitating, the past</b>. 
                This contrasted with the Renaissance, which sought to reconstruct historical ideals. Panofsky highlights 
                that human existence and its records should not be seen as ends in themselves but as means for growth and 
                understanding.

                    <h1>The Renaissance & Humanism</h1><br>

            <p>The Renaissance <b>(means literally as "rebirth")</b> (14th–16th centuries) was a rebirth of Greco-Roman culture, marked by renewed <b>interest in 
                classical texts, learning, and understanding the natural world</b>. A key aspect of this period was <b>humanism, 
                an optimistic philosophy emphasizing human potential and goodness</b>. Before the Renaissance, Christian Europeans 
                saw humanity as sinful, but this era shifted focus to appreciating human talents as part of God’s creation. 
                Humanism encouraged intellectual growth, personal responsibility, and artistic innovation, influencing both medieval 
                thought and Renaissance ideals.

                    <h1>The Northern Renaissance & Christian Humanism</h1><br>
                    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/70/166770-050-8805ACF2/Christopher-Columbus-support-chromolithograph-Isabella-I-Spain-1884.jpg" class="img" width="450" height="300">
            <p>The Renaissance began in <b>Italy, deeply rooted in its Greco-Roman heritage</b>. As it spread north to places like England, 
                Germany, and Scandinavia, classical influences were less emphasized in favor of a deeper focus on Christianity, 
                particularly its early foundations. This shift led to the rise of Christian Humanism during the Northern Renaissance.

                Unlike earlier <b>Christian teachings that emphasized Jesus' divinity, Christian Humanism focused more on his human nature—his 
                teachings, relationships, and suffering</b>. This perspective influenced religious thought and artistic expression across northern 
                Europe.

                One key result was a transformation in religious artwork. Earlier depictions of the crucifixion showed Jesus peacefully slumped 
                over, symbolizing salvation through sacrifice. However, Christian Humanist artists portrayed him in visible agony, with a tightly 
                twisted body, emphasizing his suffering. Those witnessing his death were depicted in deep grief, shifting the focus from salvation 
                to the raw emotional and physical pain of the crucifixion.
            </p><hr>
            <p>Art is a human expression deeply connected to culture, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. It explores identity, values, 
                and emotions, allowing people to experience joy, sorrow, and clarity. Art connects the past, present, and future while being interpreted 
                through history, anthropology, and literature. Its definition evolves with culture, making it a fluid and ever-changing concept.</p>
